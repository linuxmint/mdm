# Attached DISPLAY Configuration
#
[servers]
# This section defines which attached DISPLAYS should be started by MDM by
# default.  You can add as many DISPLAYS as desired and they will always be
# started.  The key for each entry must be a unique number that cooresponds to
# the DISPLAY number to start the X server.  For a typical single-display
# machine, there will only be one entry "0" for DISPLAY ":0".  The first word
# in the value corresponds to an X server definition in the "X Server
# Definitions" section of the configuration file.  For example, the entry:
#
# 0=Standard
#
# Means that DISPLAY ":0" will start an X server as defined in the 
# [server-Standard] section.
#
# The optional device argument is used to specify the device that is associated
# with the DISPLAY.  When using Virtual Terminals (VT), this value is ignored
# and MDM will use the correct device name associated with the VT.  If not
# using VT, then MDM will use the value specified by this optional argument.
# If the device argument is not defined, then MDM will use the default setting
# for attached displays defined in the UtmpLineAttached configuration option.
# For the main display (typically DISPLAY ":0"), "/dev/tty0" is a reasonable
# value.  For other displays it is probably best to not include this argument
# unless you know the specific device associated with the DISPLAY.  The device
# value can contain "%d" which is translated to the DISPLAY value or %h which
# is translated to the hostname.
#
0=Standard device=/dev/tty0
