# MDM System Defaults Configuration file.
#
# This file should not be updated by hand.  Since MDM 2.13.0.4, configuration
# choices in the MDM System Configuration file (/etc/mdm/mdm.conf) will
# override the default values specified in this file.
#
# If you were using an older version of MDM, your system may have the the older
# mdm.conf configuration file on the system.  If so, then this file is used
# instead of the MDM Custom Configuration file for backwards support.  If you
# make changes to the MDM Custom Configuration file and they seem to not be
# taking effect, this is likely the problem.  Consider migrating your
# configuration to the new configuration file and removing the mdm.conf file.
#
# You can use the mdmsetup program to graphically edit the mdm.conf-custom
# file.  Note that mdmsetup does not support every option in this file, just
# the most common ones that users want to change.  If you feel that mdmsetup
# should support additional configuration options, please file a bug report at
# http://bugzilla.gnome.org/.
#
# If you hand-edit the MDM configuration, you should run the following command
# to get the MDM daemon to recognize the change.  Any running MDM GUI programs
# will also be notified to update with the new configuration.
#
# mdmflexiserver --command="UPDATE_CONFIG <configuration key>"
#
# e.g, the "Enable" key in the "[debug]" section would be "debug/Enable".
#
# You can also run invoke-rc.d mdm reload or invoke-rc.d mdm restart
# to cause MDM to restart and re-read the new configuration settings. 
# You can also restart MDM by sending a HUP or USR1 signal to the
# daemon.  HUP behaves like restart and causes any user session
# started by MDM to exit immediately while USR1 behaves like
# reload and will wait until all users log out before
# restarting MDM.
#
# For full reference documentation see the GNOME help browser under
# GNOME|System category.  You can also find the docs in HTML form on
# http://www.gnome.org/projects/mdm/

# Attached DISPLAY Configuration

[servers]
# This section defines which attached DISPLAYS should be started by MDM by
# default.  You can add as many DISPLAYS as desired and they will always be
# started.  The key for each entry must be a unique number that cooresponds to
# the DISPLAY number to start the X server.  For a typical single-display
# machine, there will only be one entry "0" for DISPLAY ":0".  The first word
# in the value corresponds to an X server definition in the "X Server
# Definitions" section of the configuration file.  For example, the entry:
#
# 0=Standard
#
# Means that DISPLAY ":0" will start an X server as defined in the 
# [server-Standard] section.
#
# The optional device argument is used to specify the device that is associated
# with the DISPLAY.  When using Virtual Terminals (VT), this value is ignored
# and MDM will use the correct device name associated with the VT.  If not
# using VT, then MDM will use the value specified by this optional argument.
# If the device argument is not defined, then MDM will use the default setting
# for attached displays defined in the UtmpLineAttached configuration option.
# For the main display (typically DISPLAY ":0"), "/dev/console" is a reasonable
# value.  For other displays it is probably best to not include this argument
# unless you know the specific device associated with the DISPLAY.  The device
# value can contain "%d" which is translated to the DISPLAY value or %h which
